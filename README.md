# Candlestick Plot

    A candlestick chart (also called Japanese candlestick chart) is a style of financial chart used to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency. Each "candlestick" typically shows one day, thus a one-month chart may show the 20 trading days as 20 candlesticks.

    In this app, I utilize plotly and dash to display a candlestick plot of stocks of U.S companies from 2010 - 2016 , interactively. The plot also has an option to show volume of stocks.
